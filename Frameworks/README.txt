Put CouchbaseLite.framework and CouchbaseLiteListener.framework in here

You can build them by cloning https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios and hitting build on the "CBL Listener iOS" and "CBL iOS" targets. Then look in your Derived Data folder under `CouchbaseLite-blahblahblah/Build/Products/Debug-ios-Universal/`

Or you can download them from the location linked in the `couchbase-lite-ios` readme.
